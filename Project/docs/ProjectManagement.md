## Project management

In order to facilitate the communication and organization of the project, we use [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/orgs/FEUP-LEIC-ES-2022-23/projects/78/views/1). 
This project has six columns: **New**, **Backlog**, **Ready**, **In progress**, **In review**, and **Done**, the column names are quite explicit. As soon as we finish a task, we move on to the next column and so on.
